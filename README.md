# QUIZZY

Quizzy is a web app for creating and taking quizes. It is made with Python, Angular and MongoDB. You can find a live demo [here](https://quizzy-vbruzzi.herokuapp.com) (it may take a while to load).

## Setup
To set up, you should run `npm install` to install any packages needed. After that, you can run `ng serve -o` and the website will open. By default, it is connected to my Socket.IO server and API, so it will work, but if you wish to run locally you still have to run the API and the socket simultaneously. You can find the API [here](https://github.com/vbruzzi/quizzy-api) and the socket [here](https://github.com/vbruzzi/chatby-socket).
