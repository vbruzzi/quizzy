# QUIZZY

Quizzy is a web app for creating and taking quizes. It is made with Python, Angular and MongoDB. You can find a live demo [here](https://quizzy-vbruzzi.herokuapp.com) (it may take a while to load).

## Setup
To set up, you should run `npm install` to install any packages needed. After that, you can run `ng serve -o` and the website will open. This is the front-end for app, so you still have to run the API simultaneously. You can find the API [here](https://github.com/vbruzzi/quizzy-api).
